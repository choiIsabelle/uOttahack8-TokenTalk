## Github Pages Development

1. Struggled with Github pages set up.
2. Simply: Download necessary `gh-pages` dependencies in package.json
3. Update vite config
4. Make sure that on Github, 'Pages' is using the gh-pages branch
5. Could optionally integrate an action, executed upon push, that builds and deploys changes to gh pages
